## Project Overview

The FindMyMLA application is a simple web application that helps Canadian citizens find their MLA, MPP, MNA, or MHA. The application uses the postal code of the user to search for their representative, or allows a user to find their representative based on their current location. The application will return the name, party, and contact information for the representative.

This is a not-for-profit project intended to aid citizens with finding their representatives. This project was built simply with the purpose of being easily reusable and re-insertable for the open source use by other non-profits.

The application can use an individualâ€™s postal code, or can search based on their current location.


## Technical Challenges

The main challenge was integrating accurate postal code lookup and geolocation to reliably match users with their correct representatives. Ensuring data accuracy and privacy for users was also a key concern, addressed by using trusted APIs and minimal data retention.
