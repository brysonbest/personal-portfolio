## Project Overview

Pop.Eats is a responsive, single restaurant ordering app. The app serves as an intermediary for both the client (customer) and the restaurant.

Customers can log in, place orders, view their previous orders and update their profile. As a restaurant owner, the user can also update the menu as well as accept and process orders. When an order is placed, the user receives a text confirming receipt and showing the restaurantâ€™s estimated pick-up time.

This application was built on the front end using EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating) and SASS CSS styling. The backend utilizes ExpressJS, with direct PostgreSQL database interactions.

## Technical Challenges

One of the main challenges was implementing the real-time notification system to keep customers informed about their order status. This was solved by integrating the Twilio API for SMS messaging, triggered by status changes made through the admin dashboard.

Another challenge was optimizing the user experience for both customers and staff. The solution involved creating separate interfaces with different permissions and capabilities, tailored to each user type's needs.
