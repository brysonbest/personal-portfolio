## Project Overview

Pop.Eats is a full-stack food ordering application for a single restaurant. Designed to streamline the ordering process, it provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and receive SMS notifications about their order status.

Pop.Eats was developed as part of a team project to create a practical, real-world application for a fictional restaurant. The application addresses the need for a streamlined ordering system that benefits both customers and restaurant staff.

## Technical Challenges

One of the main challenges was implementing the real-time notification system to keep customers informed about their order status. This was solved by integrating the Twilio API for SMS messaging, triggered by status changes made through the admin dashboard.

Another challenge was optimizing the user experience for both customers and staff. The solution involved creating separate interfaces with different permissions and capabilities, tailored to each user type's needs.
