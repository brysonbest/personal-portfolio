## Project Overview

[WriteMyMLA](https://writemymla.streamlit.app/) is a web application that can be used by Canadians to search for and write their provincial MLA's, MPP's, MNA's, or MHA's. The application will return the name, party, and contact information for the representative, and provide the user with the opportunity to create an AI-generated letter. This is a not-for-profit project intended to aid citizens with finding and writing their representatives.

For ease of deployment and duplication by other not-for-profits, the application has been written in Python and deployed on Streamlit.io. Users may easily duplicate and deploy a version of the web application themselves.

## Technical Challenges

This project was an exercise in utilizing the OpenAI API to create a controlled response and return a consistent, specific product. The goal was to utilize this API to prove that [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) can be utilized by non-profits to provide citizens with additional support in engaging with their provincial representatives. Ensuring privacy and responsible AI use were key challenges.
