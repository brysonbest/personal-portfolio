## Project Overview

The Pro-Bone-O web application is a draft application intended to help dog owners find free dog walking/sitting services in their area utilizing the Google Maps API. This app uses React and Recoil on the frontend, with PostgreSQL and Express for the database and backend server.

A limited version of the app was deployed on [Netlify for demo purposes](https://pro-bone-o.netlify.app/) but is not production ready. The video below is a silent walk through of the features and interactions available through the web application.
