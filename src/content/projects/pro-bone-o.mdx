## Project Overview

 web application is a draft application intended to help dog owners find free dog walking/sitting services in their area utilizing the Google Maps API. This app uses React and Recoil on the frontend, with PostgreSQL and Express for the database and backend server.

A limited version of the app was deployed on [Netlify for demo purposes](https://pro-bone-o.netlify.app/) but is not production ready. The video below is a silent walk through of the features and interactions available through the web application.

This application was built on the front end using ReactJS, with SASS and MUI React Material components for styling. The backend utilizes ExpressJS, with PostgreSQL managed through the Prisma ORM.

## Technical Challenges

A significant challenge was designing a system flexible enough to accommodate different clients while maintaining ease of use. This was addressed by implementing multiple types and levels of access.
